# Permission fixes for running as a test environment.
# Assumption: This docker image is not used outside build and test
# environments.
# $GOPATH: conflicts with local volume mount of /src:
#    This mount provides a live code editing environment.
#    It is not accessed as root (must use the host's UID namespace to write
#    back to the volume) so to have a single process reading $GOPATH and /src
#    simultaneously we need open permissions.
# $HOME/.cache:
#    go expects $HOME/.cache to be writable but in the recommended test
#    environment, $HOME is /, so pre-create .cache too.
